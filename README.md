## What is this?

A Live2D motion file (`.motion3.json`) is just JSON — a set of keyframe curves per model parameter. That means you can create new motions with a text editor alone, as long as you stay within the parameters the model already has. No rigging, no mesh editing.

This repository adds the following 7 motions to the official Live2D sample model "Hiyori", using JSON only:

| Motion | Main parameters used |
|---|---|
| Happy | Smiling eyes (EyeSmile) + mouth form + cheek blush + body bounce |
| Wink | Single-eye blink + head tilt |
| Nod | Head pitch (double nod) |
| Thinking | Head tilt + averted gaze + furrowed brows |
| Surprised | Widened eyes + raised brows + "o" mouth + lean back |
| Shy | Cheek blush + looking down + lowered eyelids |
| Head shake | Head yaw oscillation |

For reproducibility, motions are not hand-written: they are built by a pipeline of **a generator script + an independent validator + headless-browser verification**. The repository also ships agent-facing documentation ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)) so you can ask an AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) to "add a new motion" and have it work autonomously.

## Quick start

Requirements: **Python 3** (standard library only), a **modern browser**, and a coding agent such as Claude Code / Codex.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinshin86/live2d-add-motion-sample-web-ui.git
cd live2d-add-motion-sample-web-ui
```

Launch your agent at the repository root and **just ask, mentioning where your model is**:

> There is a Live2D model at `~/Downloads/model.zip`. Add motions to this model and make them viewable in the browser.

The agent handles everything — placing the model, setup, motion design, generation, validation, and starting the server (the workflow is defined in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which agents read automatically). A zip or a folder works, located anywhere.

If you don't have a model, download the official sample model ["Hiyori Momose (hiyori_pro)"](https://www.live2d.com/en/learn/sample/momose-hiyori/) — the bundled sample motion definitions work with it out of the box.

Adding or changing motions is also just a request:

> Add a "waving hand" motion to this model. If it cannot be made naturally with the existing parameters, do not force it — propose alternatives instead.

### Run manually

```bash
python3 tools/setup_model.py <model zip or folder>   # place model + generate model.config.json
python3 tools/gen_motions.py        # generate + register motions
python3 tools/validate_motions.py   # validate (should print "OK")

python3 tools/serve.py              # serve (default port: 17342)
# → http://localhost:17342
```

Motion definitions live in `motion-defs/<model-name>.py`, one file per model (a sample definition is bundled as a reference). A different model needs its own definitions matching its parameters — that design work is exactly what you delegate to the AI agent. Definition files are treated as per-model workspace artifacts and are git-ignored just like `models/`, so switching models never dirties the repository.

## Using the WebUI

- Play the newly added motions from the highlighted card (★ buttons); existing motions are in the collapsible sections below
- **Drag** the avatar to move it, **mouse wheel / pinch** to zoom around the cursor, and "Reset view" to restore the initial placement
- Debug query parameters: `?play=Action:0` (auto-play), `&freeze=1.2` (freeze the pose at a given second), `?uitest=1` (automated drag/zoom test)
- The UI defaults to English and automatically uses Japanese when the browser's primary locale is Japanese. Use `?lang=en` or `?lang=ja` to override locale detection.

## Adding your own motions

If you use an AI agent, just reuse the prompt from the quick start (change the motion name). To do it manually:

1. `python3 tools/analyze_model.py` — inspect available parameters, their safe value ranges, and physics-driven parameters (do not animate those directly)
2. Add your keyframes to `motion-defs/<model-name>.py` (see the bundled sample for the format)
3. Generate → validate → verify in a browser:

```bash
python3 tools/gen_motions.py
python3 tools/validate_motions.py
tools/verify_browser.sh   # captures peak poses with headless Chrome (Chrome required)
```

Design rules (value ranges, returning to the base pose, avoiding physics-driven parameters, etc.) and model-specific knowledge are documented in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). It is written for AI agents but useful for humans too.
